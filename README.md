# Capstone Project â€“ Java Ledger App

This is a simple command-line Java application that lets users track deposits and payments. It was built as part of our 3-week Capstone project focused on applying core Java skills.

## ðŸ“Œ What this app does

The app simulates a basic ledger system where users can:

- Add a deposit (positive transaction)
- Make a payment (negative transaction)
- View all transactions
- Filter transactions by type or time period
- Search by vendor
- View a summary of total amounts per vendor

All data is stored in a local `.csv` file. When the app starts, it loads previous data; when users add something new, it's saved.
